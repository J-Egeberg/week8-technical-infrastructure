#Week 8: Technical infrastructure
##What will happen:
This week is a preparation for starting on the semester project. In this week we will focus on:
### 2days on GIT:
These 2 days covers what you need to know to work efficiently as a team using git and github for code collaboration, version control and backup.  
- Learning collaboration with git 
  - What and why
  - Installing git 
  - Creating repository on github  
  - Add collaborators (team members)  
  - Cloning repository  
  - git commands like: add, commit, push, fetch, merge  
  - Create branches  
  - Merge branches with rebase  
  - Forking a project
  - Making a pull request  
  - Using git issues   
  - Labels and notifications  
  - 3 typical work flows  
    - Centralized workflow (most simple and easy to use - small projects)  
    - Feature Branch workflow (good for team collaboration on each feature - larger projects)  
    - Forking workflow (good for opensource projects with untrusted third parties)


##Studymaterial:
The book: Pro GIT [Mainly chapter 2-4](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)  
Good explanation of the 3 workflows [](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)  
This is a small interactive tutorial on branching [here](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)  


#Technical infra structure
This week will focus on getting the technical infrastructure up and running. There are two topics for this week:

* Getting some initial code for the project up and running before the fall break
* Getting this initial code into git and shared on github

##Day 1 - recapitulate JDBC
We will go over how to use jdbc again. We will work an writing a java program which will _populate_ a database. 

Readings and exercises are at:

* [readings](study/day1readme.md)
* [exercises](study/day1exercises.md)

##Day 2 & 3
Workshop on GIT

##Day 4 - recapitulate Servlets
We will go over how to use servlets to access and present the data we put in the database on monday. 

* [Exercises](study/day4Exercises.md)
* Study the program webbuildings in the demo folder

##Day 5 - Studypoint exercise
See [Studypoint Exercise](study/day5SPexercise.md)
